            She has been exposed to a wide range of field types and operations in the oil and gas industry. She has worked in gas fields in the Barnett Shale, heavy oil fields in Bakersfield, CA, and deepwater and shelf assets in the Gulf of Mexico. These fields gave her exposure to operations like frac jobs, various artificial lift techniques, well stimulations techniques, steam floods, wireline operations, and drilling operations. She is fairly independent, but enjoy working in open environments and group settings. She also likes to be challenged technically and has a high aptitude for learning new things.
